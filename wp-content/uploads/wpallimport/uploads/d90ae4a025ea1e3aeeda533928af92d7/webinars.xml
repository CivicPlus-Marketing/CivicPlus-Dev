		<title><![CDATA[Change is Good. How to Live it, Love it, and Lead it.]]></title>
		<content><![CDATA[Clerks are essential leaders in local government and are known for their consistency and reliability. However, nothing could have prepared our communities or their leaders for the shifts and changes needed to adjust to an unprecedented global pandemic, many of which were changes to processes and workflows and were technology-oriented.

While some unexpected benefits for staff and citizens have emerged from recent administrative changes—such as the rise of virtual meetings—it doesn’t mean that changes have been easy for those who have established processes and preferences over the course of years or even decades.

If you’re exploring how the past year will impact you and your role as a clerk long-term or hoping to be a positive agent of change among peers who are hesitant to step outside of their comfort zone, this recording will help you:

Assess your fears and feelings about change
Understand why humans are sometimes resistant to positive change like new technology or processes
Identify strategies that you can use every day to lead your organization through change]]></content>

		<title><![CDATA[Crisis Communication Planning for Local Governments]]></title>
		<content><![CDATA[Local governments are being asked to do more with less more often. They are also tasked with dealing with a variety of threats that can put their citizens in danger.

What do you do when a crisis impacts your community and threatens to harm people and property and interrupts your regular operations? How do you keep your citizens safe and informed?

Every local government needs to be ready and prepared to communicate before, during, and after a crisis or disaster situation. Crisis communication planning is for every government, large and small.

This webinar discusses: 

Elements of a crisis communication plan
Social media and its role during a crisis situation
Mass communication tools and implementing them in an emergency

]]></title>
		<content><![CDATA[The Americans with Disabilities Act (ADA) was signed into law on July 26, 1990, to recognize and protect the civil rights of those people with disabilities and to guarantee they have the same opportunities to participate in American life as everyone else. As the years have passed and evolutions in technology have made leaps and bounds, the ADA is more important now than ever before because so many people rely on their governments for public services.

In this recording, our accessibility expert, Angie Brunk, discusses her own experience in navigating government websites as a sight impaired UX designer, best practices for accessible government website design and functions, and what is on the horizon for ADA compliance.

She has taught basic graphic design courses for communications majors and incorporated basic graphic design into her practice as a librarian.

A poster and a short paper for the Cambridge Workshop on Universal Access and Assistive Technology
Presentation on accessible and inclusive design for library marketing at Library Marketing and Communications

		<title><![CDATA[Managing Your COVID-19 Communications Using Multi-Channel Tech]]></title>
		<content><![CDATA[Ask any citizen what the one thing was that they wanted most from their local government at the height of the COVID-19 crisis (and still today), and they’ll tell you communication. COVID-19 has redefined citizens’ relationships with their local government. Your citizens want regular, proactive, transparent news, updates, information, and guidance, and they want it from every possible communication channel.

Fortunately, all you need to deliver on these expectations is a content management system (CMS) with multi-channel communication functionality.

Join us as we share best practices from users of our CivicEngage® CMS who have leveraged its functionality to keep citizens safe and informed during the COVID-19 crisis. Attendees will leave this event with new ideas for amplifying the reach of pandemic news, updates, and instructions.]]></content>
